<p>Our days just wouldn't be the same if we didn't have multiple opportunities to delight in cats. It's not like you didn't know the truth about our cat obsession, right?</p><p>If cats are willing to share their lives with us lowly humans, the least we can do is document all the highs and lows, and everything in between... Of course, that's precisely what we do with our cats, isn't it?</p><p>We are hopelessly addicted to our cats and everything our cats do, whether our kitty friends are being naughty, silly, or sincerely sweet: we are on top of documenting it. We would never forgive ourselves if we didn't capture all the cat moments and more importantly, if we didn't share our cat shenanigans with the world.</p>
